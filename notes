function address_list (network, xpub, chain, start, end) - derive list of addresses from start to end xpub for btc test network
function add_wallet (network, name, addresses) - add address list to block cipher and assign it a name
function add_addresses (network, name, addresses),
function fetch_wallet (network, name),
function utxo_for_coinselect( utxolist),
function fetch_utxo (network, receive_wallet, change_wallet ),


after that you have to create a function for generating unsigned transaction, 
this function will accept list of utxos, recipient address and amount. You may 
use this https://github.com/bitcoinjs/coinselect for selecting inputs for unsigned 
transaction, and output for unsigned transaction will be taken from recipient address(and amount)

refer this for creating unsigned transaction https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib/issues/1011#issuecomment-368397505
